### WEEK 1 - Introduction to HTML5

In this module we will learn the basics of HTML5. We'll start with instructional videos on how to set up your development environment, go over HTML5 basics like valid document structure, which elements can be included inside other elements and which can not, discuss the meaning and usefulness of HTML5 semantic tags, and go over essential HTML5 tags.

### WEEK 2 - Introduction to CSS3

In this module we learn from the very basics of CSS3 to some fairly advanced concepts like floating and CSS rule conflict resolution. We'll go over the 'box model', background property, etc. We'll finish off the module with learning about Responsive Design as well as start Twitter Bootstrap with its essential Grid System.

### WEEK 3 - Coding the Static Restaurant Site

In this module we build a real web site for a business from scratch.
 
### WEEK 4 - Introduction to Javascript

In this module we’ll cover just about everything - from common language constructs and Javascript types to objects, functions, arrays, closures, and scope isolation.

### WEEK 5 - Using Javascript to Build Web Applications

In this module, we are going to take all those newly learned Javascript language skills and learn how to utilize them within the context of a web page. We’ll start by learning how to properly manipulate the web page components using the Javascript Document Object Model API. We will then move on to learning one of the most popular ways of serving up data to a web site - Ajax. We'll learn about the protocol that the language of the web speaks in (HTTP), how to set up and handle Ajax requests and responses, as well as how to process JSON data. We'll finish the module by connecting our restaurant web site from Module 3 to a real backend service that will allow us to pull the data for the restaurant menu dynamically from the server without having to reload the entire page.
